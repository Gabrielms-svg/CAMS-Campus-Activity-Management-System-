# CAMS-Campus-Activity-Management-System-
The Campus Activity Management System (CAMS) is an online platform designed to 
streamline the management and participation of various activities within a campus, 
including sports, arts, and other events. The system facilitates the smooth operation of 
campus activities by involving three distinct user roles: Admin, Faculty, and Student. 
The Admin is responsible for managing the overall system, including adding or 
removing faculty members, restricting or removing students, and overseeing all 
activities. Admins can also create, modify, or delete activities and access detailed 
student information. Faculty members can add, modify, or remove activities, monitor 
student participation, and issue participation certificates upon verification. Students 
can view and apply for activities, cancel participation if needed, download their 
participation certificates, and track activity points and semester-wise reports. The 
system aims to enhance the management efficiency and participation experience for all 
campus stakeholders by providing a user-friendly and organized platform for campus 
activities.
